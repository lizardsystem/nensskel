Post-nensskel project setup TODO
--------------------------------

Here are some instructions on what to do after you've created a leansite with
nensskel.

- Fill in a short description on https://github.com/nens/$project if you
  haven't done so already.

- Use the same description in the ``setup.py``'s "description" field.

- Fill in your username and email address in the ``setup.py``, see the
  ``TODO`` fields.

- Check https://github.com/nens/$project/settings/collaboration if the teams
  "Nelen & Schuurmans" and "Nelen & Schuurmans pull only" have access.

- Add a new jenkins job at
  http://buildbot.lizardsystem.nl/jenkins/view/<subdir>/newJob. Job name should
  be "${project}", make the project a copy of the existing "wro" (for
  instance) project. On the next page, change the "github project" to
  ``https://github.com/nens/${project}/`` and
  "repository url" fields to ``git@github.com:nens/${project}.git``. The rest
  of the settings should be OK.

- The project is prepared to be translated with Lizard's
  `Transifex <http://translations.lizard.net/>`_ server. For details about
  pushing translation files to and fetching translation files from the
  Transifex server, see the ``nens/translations`` `documentation
  <https://github.com/nens/translations/blob/master/README.rst>`_.

- A site needs to be in `Sentry <https://sentry.lizard.net/>`_.
  For more information: `Sentry integration <https://sentry.lizard.net/NenS/<subdir>/docs/django/>`.
  The API key can be found here: `API Key <https://sentry.lizard.net/NenS/<subdir>/keys/>`.


Initial setup
--------------

Initially, there's no ``buildout.cfg``. You have to make a symlink to the
correct configuration. On your development machine that is ``buildout/development.cfg`` 
(``staging.cfg`` and ``production.cfg``, respectively on staging and production::

    $ ln -s buildout/development.cfg buildout.cfg

Then run bootstrap and buildout::

    $ python buildout/bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout

Set up a database (and yes, set up an admin user when asked)::

    $ bin/django syncdb
    $ bin/django migrate

Start the server::

    $ bin/django runserver
