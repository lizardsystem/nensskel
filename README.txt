Paster skeletons for Nelen & Schuurmans
=======================================


``nensskel`` provides paster templates for easy creation of new websites,
libraries and so on.

- **website** for just a basic buildout setup and some apache config.  And a
  readme, changes, etc.

What to do with this after running buildout?  Go to your tempdir and try it out::

    $> bin/paster create -t nens_library sampleproject

and you should be set to go.

You can use `bin/paster create --list-templates` to get a list of templates.
