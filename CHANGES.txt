Changelog for nensskel
======================


1.11 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Added django-sentry to the Lizardsite template.
- Adding new file setup.py_tmpl to Lizardsite template.
- Updating +package+/settings.py_tmpl which adds sentry to INSTALLED_APPS.


1.10 (2011-03-31)
-----------------

- Adding mostly-empty READMEs to the two empty 'fixtures' and
  'media/+package+' dirs in the django app template. On some machines, the
  empty directories were not getting created. This way they are.

- Svn-ignoring the ``doc/build`` directory (with sphinx output).

- Added ``svn revert`` instructions for ``testsettings.py`` in the website
  template (in addition to removing the file).


1.9 (2011-03-02)
----------------

- Small restructured text heading level fixes for the sphinx documentation.


1.8 (2011-02-01)
----------------

- Removed buildout usage part from the readme.rst as it gets repeated
  lots of times all over the place this way.

- Added matplotlib tweaks to the django site settings.py.

- Added django-extensions to the standard dependencies of django apps
  so that we can get a model graph.


1.7 (2011-01-19)
----------------

- Added sphinx setup.  Also swapped the .txt files for .rst ones.


1.6.1 (2010-12-03)
------------------

- Fixed too-restrictive regex in apache's openlayers AliasMatch: the
  openlayers css/icons now also work in the root of the site...


1.6 (2010-12-03)
----------------

- Added sysegg part to the buildouts.


1.5 (2010-12-03)
----------------

- Printing .egginfo directory removal instructions.

- Updated list of standard svn:ignores.

- Added django gzip middleware to the lizardsite template.

- Added lizard-ui's traceback logging middleware to lizardsite.

- Added lizard-map's map settings to the django settings.py in lizardsite.

- Removed windows apache configuration.

- Added gzip ("mod_deflate") for js/css in the apache config.

- Eternally caching the django-compressor combined js/css files.

- Added logging setup to lizardsite.

- Added 500.html and 404.html to lizardsite template.

- Added openlayers img/ and theme/ aliases to compensate for openlayers'
  weirdness.

- Added extra part to the lizardsite buildout for automatic ``bin/django
  build_static`` running so we won't ever forget to do that.

- Updated database settings to new django multiple databases style.


1.4 (2010-10-15)
----------------

- Added setup.cfg that tells nose to output xml test reports for use with
  Hudson.

- Fixes to the test setup of django_app.


1.3 (2010-10-01)
----------------

- Added copyright notice at the top of every file including pointer to the
  LICENSE.txt GPL file.  No, I'm not copy/pasting 10 unneeded lines of GPL
  boilerplate into every file.


1.2 (2010-08-25)
----------------

- Bootstrap.py adjustments: using the 1.4.x buildout one for now.


1.1.1 (2010-08-10)
------------------

- Documentation update.


1.1 (2010-08-10)
----------------

- Changed test setup of djangoapp and lizardsite to match Reinout's latest
  experiments :-)


1.0 (2010-08-03)
----------------

- Added coverage support both to nensskel itself and to the templates.


0.5 (2010-08-02)
----------------

- Added django compressor settings to the lizardsite template.

- Added lizard-ui as a standard dependency for django applications.


0.4 (2010-05-20)
----------------

- Removed ipython as it regularly fails to download, sadly.  Can be re-added
  after buildout gains a timeout setting (in the .cfg files).


0.3 (2010-03-22)
----------------

- Django STATIC_URL/MEDIA_URL clarification and usage improvement after
  discussion on http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-staticfiles/issue/12/

- Added apache config (with a separate one for windows that still needs some
  work).


0.2 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Django fixes after using skeleton in real life.


0.1 (2010-02-11)
----------------

- Added ``nensskel`` script as a handy wrapper around ``paster create``.

- Added lizardsite skeleton (which needs checking and probably modifications).

- Added djangoapp skeleton.

- Added library skeleton.

- Added test that creates instances of all skeletons and runs their
  bin/buildout.  Smoke test: switch everything on and see if smoke comes out.

- Reinout copied relevant parts from the thaskel and zestskel that he made for
  the two previous companies he worked for.
