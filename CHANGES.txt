  work).

- Django fixes after using skeleton in real life.


0.1 (2010-02-11)
----------------

- Added ``nensskel`` script as a handy wrapper around ``paster create``.

- Added lizardsite skeleton (which needs checking and probably modifications).

- Added djangoapp skeleton.

- Added library skeleton.

- Added test that creates instances of all skeletons and runs their
  bin/buildout.  Smoke test: switch everything on and see if smoke comes out.

- Reinout copied relevant parts from the thaskel and zestskel that he made for
  the two previous companies he worked for.
