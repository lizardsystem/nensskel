Changelog for nensskel
======================


0.5 (unreleased)
----------------

- Added django compressor settings to the lizardsite template.

- Added lizard-ui as a standard dependency for django applications.


0.4 (2010-05-20)

  after buildout gains a timeout setting (in the .cfg files).


0.3 (2010-03-22)
----------------

- Django STATIC_URL/MEDIA_URL clarification and usage improvement after
  discussion on http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-staticfiles/issue/12/

- Added apache config (with a separate one for windows that still needs some
  work).


0.2 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Django fixes after using skeleton in real life.


0.1 (2010-02-11)
----------------

- Added ``nensskel`` script as a handy wrapper around ``paster create``.

- Added lizardsite skeleton (which needs checking and probably modifications).

- Added djangoapp skeleton.

- Added library skeleton.

- Added test that creates instances of all skeletons and runs their
  bin/buildout.  Smoke test: switch everything on and see if smoke comes out.

- Reinout copied relevant parts from the thaskel and zestskel that he made for
  the two previous companies he worked for.
