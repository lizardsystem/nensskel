Changelog for nensskel
======================


1.31 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.30 (2013-02-11)
-----------------

- Added buildout 2.0!

- Added a django-session-cleanup-cronjob part for production and staging,
  which cleans old sessions in the database.

- Added nose coverage report setup. And included mock by default.

- Added ``__future__`` imports everywhere for print statements and unicode.
  Everywhere except django settings, btw, as that weirdly breaks the
  testrunner!


1.29 (2012-10-11)
-----------------

- The library buildout.cfg now also extends the latest KGS; this
  prevents problems with mismatched buildout versions.


1.28 (2012-10-11)
-----------------

- Fixed license header (small tweak only: it pointed to LICENSE.txt
  instead of the .rst one).

- Added max log size of 10MB to the logrotate script in the lizard
  site template.


1.27 (2012-09-24)
-----------------

- Added lizard-wms (and lizard-maptree) to the lizardsite template. Almost
  every site needs them and it makes the empty site more suited for demo
  purposes and experimenting.


1.26 (2012-06-28)
-----------------

- Fixed small issues in the lizardsite template:

  - Added ``auto-checkout`` plus explanation to its buildout config.

  - Generated random password for the production/staging databases.

  - Using site name as database name.


1.25 (2012-06-26)
-----------------

- Git instructions are now printed after generating the project (if we're not
  generating an svn project). It assumes nens/lizardsystem github URLs (which
  you can change, of course).

- Added more example imports to ``views.py`` and ``models.py``, for instance
  the ``ugettext``/``ugettext_lazy`` import. And the lizard-ui and lizard-map
  base class based views.

- Added example class based view configuration in ``urls.py``.

- Added ``admin.py``.

- Added the ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` import to use unicode
  everywhere.

- Updated .gitignore: we now ignore the nginx config files instead of the
  not-used-anymore apache ones.


1.24 (2012-06-19)
-----------------

- Added nensskel version number to the generated 'initial generation'
  changelog entry.

- Removed TODO.rst from all the templates. We don't actually use it.

- Added configuration for testing `on travis
  <http://travis-ci.org/#!/lizardsystem/nensskel>`_.

- Using url() instead of tuples in the url patterns again. Plus fixed syntax
  error there.

- Updated lizardsite skeleton to latest server configuration and
  fabfile.

- Added stagingsettings.py, staging.cfg

- Made tests work


1.22 (2011-12-08)
-----------------

- Added a templates/ subdirectory to the djangoapp.

- Renamed media/ dir in djangoapp to static/ to match Django 1.3.


1.21 (2011-11-15)
-----------------

- Using latest and greatest server setup. Including nginx and sitesetup.


1.20 (2011-10-21)
-----------------

- Added MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT to the djangoapp template. The debugmode
  urlpatterns loaded in ``urls.py`` fail with a traceback otherwise.


1.19 (2011-10-18)
-----------------

- Updated the .coveragerc to be more complete.


1.18 (2011-10-18)
-----------------

- Not git-ignoring ``*.mo`` files by default: django doesn't compile them on
  the fly, so they need to be included with the source code.

- Using 'graft' option in the MANIFEST.in to just include everything in our
  project directory. .pyc/pyo files are excluded anyway, so this is more or
  less OK.


1.17 (2011-09-30)
-----------------

- Important bugfix: the "hidden" ``.something`` files weren't being
  generated. They *are* now.


1.16 (2011-09-09)
-----------------

- Added git ignore file and basic MANIFEST.in to the templates.

- Removed unneeded lizard-ui middleware as django 1.3's logging handles it.

- Adjusted context processors to django 1.3's default list.

- Added logging setup for sentry in the lizard site template.

- Cleaned up the urls.py from djangoapp.


1.15 (2011-08-25)
-----------------

- Added the KGS to djangoapp and sites and updated for django 1.3.

- Removed map_settings from lizardsite settings.py.

- Commented out wsgiimmportscript in apache conf (it gives an error).

- Added lizard-map context processor (outcommented) in lizardsite
  settings.py.


1.14 (2011-05-30)
-----------------

- Adding deadlock-timeout and especially display-name to the wsgi config. The
  deadlock might help with shapefiles clogging up the server. The display-name
  shows you which server is actually using up the CPU/mem instead of just
  showing 'apache2'.


1.13 (2011-05-23)
-----------------

- Re-release of 1.12 as that download tarball was broken.

- Adding django.contrib.gis to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` lists as that's needed
  for south migrations of geo fields.

- nens_djangoapp's ``testsettings.py`` was missing an ``import os``.


1.12 (2011-04-13)
-----------------

- Modifying the middleware to include SentryResponseErrorIdMiddleware.


1.11 (2011-04-13)
-----------------

- Added django-sentry to the Lizardsite template.
- Adding new file setup.py_tmpl to Lizardsite template.
- Updating +package+/settings.py_tmpl which adds sentry to INSTALLED_APPS.


1.10 (2011-03-31)
-----------------

- Adding mostly-empty READMEs to the two empty 'fixtures' and
  'media/+package+' dirs in the django app template. On some machines, the
  empty directories were not getting created. This way they are.

- Svn-ignoring the ``doc/build`` directory (with sphinx output).

- Added ``svn revert`` instructions for ``testsettings.py`` in the website
  template (in addition to removing the file).


1.9 (2011-03-02)
----------------

- Small restructured text heading level fixes for the sphinx documentation.


1.8 (2011-02-01)
----------------

- Removed buildout usage part from the readme.rst as it gets repeated
  lots of times all over the place this way.

- Added matplotlib tweaks to the django site settings.py.

- Added django-extensions to the standard dependencies of django apps
  so that we can get a model graph.


1.7 (2011-01-19)
----------------

- Added sphinx setup.  Also swapped the .txt files for .rst ones.


1.6.1 (2010-12-03)
------------------

- Fixed too-restrictive regex in apache's openlayers AliasMatch: the
  openlayers css/icons now also work in the root of the site...


1.6 (2010-12-03)
----------------

- Added sysegg part to the buildouts.


1.5 (2010-12-03)
----------------

- Printing .egginfo directory removal instructions.

- Updated list of standard svn:ignores.

- Added django gzip middleware to the lizardsite template.

- Added lizard-ui's traceback logging middleware to lizardsite.

- Added lizard-map's map settings to the django settings.py in lizardsite.

- Removed windows apache configuration.

- Added gzip ("mod_deflate") for js/css in the apache config.

- Eternally caching the django-compressor combined js/css files.

- Added logging setup to lizardsite.

- Added 500.html and 404.html to lizardsite template.

- Added openlayers img/ and theme/ aliases to compensate for openlayers'
  weirdness.

- Added extra part to the lizardsite buildout for automatic ``bin/django
  build_static`` running so we won't ever forget to do that.

- Updated database settings to new django multiple databases style.


1.4 (2010-10-15)
----------------

- Added setup.cfg that tells nose to output xml test reports for use with
  Hudson.

- Fixes to the test setup of django_app.


1.3 (2010-10-01)
----------------

- Added copyright notice at the top of every file including pointer to the
  LICENSE.txt GPL file.  No, I'm not copy/pasting 10 unneeded lines of GPL
  boilerplate into every file.


1.2 (2010-08-25)
----------------

- Bootstrap.py adjustments: using the 1.4.x buildout one for now.


1.1.1 (2010-08-10)
------------------

- Documentation update.


1.1 (2010-08-10)
----------------

- Changed test setup of djangoapp and lizardsite to match Reinout's latest
  experiments :-)


1.0 (2010-08-03)
----------------

- Added coverage support both to nensskel itself and to the templates.


0.5 (2010-08-02)
----------------

- Added django compressor settings to the lizardsite template.

- Added lizard-ui as a standard dependency for django applications.


0.4 (2010-05-20)
----------------

- Removed ipython as it regularly fails to download, sadly.  Can be re-added
  after buildout gains a timeout setting (in the .cfg files).


0.3 (2010-03-22)
----------------

- Django STATIC_URL/MEDIA_URL clarification and usage improvement after
  discussion on http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-staticfiles/issue/12/

- Added apache config (with a separate one for windows that still needs some
  work).


0.2 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Django fixes after using skeleton in real life.


0.1 (2010-02-11)
----------------

- Added ``nensskel`` script as a handy wrapper around ``paster create``.

- Added lizardsite skeleton (which needs checking and probably modifications).

- Added djangoapp skeleton.

- Added library skeleton.

- Added test that creates instances of all skeletons and runs their
  bin/buildout.  Smoke test: switch everything on and see if smoke comes out.

- Reinout copied relevant parts from the thaskel and zestskel that he made for
  the two previous companies he worked for.
